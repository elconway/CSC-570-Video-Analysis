## Setup Instructions ##
Install gradle: https://gradle.org/install/  
Once you've installed gradle, set up the clientID and clientSecret in DanceDelegate  
Run the project by doing
```shell
./gradlew run
```
gradlew is the wrapper script  
build.gradle.kts is the build file which is written in Kotlin, but for our purposes it's basically just a dependency manager  
Gradle expects all java files to be in src/java  
Initial builds of gradle will be slow, but they become faster
